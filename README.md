- 👋 Hi, I’m @jasmine-ship-it
- 👀 I’m interested in React.js, Node.js, Express, JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, Boostrap
- 🌱 I’ve finished my bootcamp courses:
     - Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)- by Andrei Neagoi (zerotomastery.io)
     - The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 by Colt Steele
- I have completed my first Art Gallery project based on The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022. My client, Chen Yuan has reviewed the initial launch and is happy with the features that I have introduced. I am introducing more features and will be implementing some unit testing in my next steps.
- Connect4 game was a fun initial self project to start off with and involved quite a lot of thinking and planning for the logics behind the game and how best to render.
- I am continuing to develop my apps and especially focusing on Runsam (a self-dveloepd running app using React.js which will hopefully be useful in helping me track my health and fitness)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Please DM me
- 📫 Can always DM me!
