👋 Hi, I’m @jasmine-ship-it!
👀 I’m passionate about:
- React.js
- Node.js
- Express
- JavaScript
- Python
- MongoDB

🌱 I’ve finished my bootcamp courses:
- **Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)** by Andrei Neagoi (zerotomastery.io)

- **The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022** by Colt Steele

I completed my first Art Gallery project based on The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022. My client, Chen Yuan, has reviewed the initial launch and is happy with the features that I have introduced. I am currently working on adding more features and implementing unit testing.

Connect4 game was a fun initial self project to start off with and involved quite a lot of thinking and planning for the logics behind the game and how best to render.

I am also developing two other projects:
- Runsam, a self-developed running app using React.js, to help track my health and fitness
- BabyKicks, a user-friendly app designed to help expectant mothers monitor their baby's movements during pregnancy
